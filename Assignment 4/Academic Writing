🔐🧑‍🔬Self Reflection🧑‍🔬🔐
I was exposed to the realities of work in the information technology area through the speech presented by Ts. Hj. Abdul Alim bin Abdul Mutallib. I learned the significance of knowing the System Development Life Cycle concepts in particular through his experiences.
Moreover, his talk on the role of system development and project management in different areas of computing opened my eyes to see the importance of both in making sure that a project can be effectively implemented. In general, this talk inspired me to be always prepared both in knowledge and skills to overcome future challenges in my career.
