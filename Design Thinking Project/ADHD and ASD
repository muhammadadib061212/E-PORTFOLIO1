🛠️📊Self Reflection📊🛠️
Design thinking is the iterative process to solve complex problems with deep understanding from the user perspective. In this course, Technology and Systems Information, we were assigned to create a website or an application that would help the community of ADHD or ASD.
Overall, this project has helped me a lot in terms of team collaboration to the way I think about solving complex problems in order to produce a good quality prototype. I also very much appreciate and thank all my team members, who provided excellent cooperation.
