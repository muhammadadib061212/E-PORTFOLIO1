🧩🔍self reflection🔍🧩
My friends and I participated in UTM Digital Day on October 29. We had the chance to hear Mr. Helmee bin Yaacob speak about project management and system development. Throughout his tenure at UTM Digital, he has shared his experiences and adventures. I was encouraged and driven to constantly put in a lot of effort in my studies after hearing him speak.
Additionally, we went to booths for IT firms like Oracle. I've learnt a lot of things that will be useful to me in the future.
