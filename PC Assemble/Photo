🖼️🎨Self Reflection🎨🖼️
On the 12th of November, me and my groupmates were assigned the project to take a PC apart and reassemble it. This is the first time for me to see the process and be a part of it.
This was a task where group work was involved, and observation and precision were needed. This particular task gave me the opportunity to develop my practical skills because the process involved was such that one had to be very careful not to touch some of the sensitive parts.
It has helped me in gaining more knowledge about how the components in a PC work and the importance of installing all components in their places.
